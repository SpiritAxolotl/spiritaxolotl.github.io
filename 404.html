      TL;DR:<br>
      In the url replace "spiritaxolotl.github.io" with "spax.zone" to find the page you're looking for.

      Hey! You clicked on an old link!

      Unfortunately I don't use github pages to host my site anymore.

      In 2024 I bought the <a href="https://spax.zone">spax.zone</a> domain and started using cloudflare to publish it instead.
    </article>
    <article who="spax" emotion="happy">
      Cloudflare is actually a great hosting provider! I can set up serverside redirects and it builds much faster than github.

    <article who="spax" emotion="look">
      The only downside to switching is that all of my old links from the .github.io site are now defunct.

      Which brings me to you, user. You disabled javascript didn't you!
    </article>
    <article who="spax" emotion="neutral">
      Don't worry, I commend you. The web is getting more dangerous every day.
    </article>
    <article who="spax" emotion="talk">
      However for this site, I <i>do</i> have a singular line of javascript:
    </article>
    <article>
      window.location.hostname = "spax.zone";
    </article>
    <article who="spax" emotion="look">
      (This is actually a lie but in essence it basically does that.)
    </article>
    <article who="spax" emotion="smirk">
      Even if you don't program, you can see that it just changes the domain to "spax.zone", keeping the page you were on intact.
    </article>
    <article who="spax" emotion="look">
      Since you don't have javascript on this site though, I'll need to ask you to do it manually so you can see the site you expected.
    </article>
    <article who="spax" emotion="pensive">
      I wish I could do it with serverside redirection, but unfortunately github pages does not have that feature.
    </article>
    <article who="spax" emotion="blush">
      Regardless! I hope you find the page you were looking for!
